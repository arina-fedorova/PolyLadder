# PolyLadder Documentation

**Documentation has been moved to [PolyLadderCommon](https://github.com/arina-fedorova/PolyLadderCommon).**

## Quick Links

All documentation is now centralized in the PolyLadderCommon repository:

- [Technical Specification](../../PolyLadderCommon/docs/polyladder/TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md)
- [System Architecture](../../PolyLadderCommon/docs/architecture/SEPARATION_PLAN.md)
- [Documentation Index](../../PolyLadderCommon/docs/README.md)

## Why?

The PolyLadder ecosystem is being separated into multiple repositories:

- **PolyLadder** (this repo) - Learner-facing application (public)
- **PolyLadderAdmin** - Operator dashboard (private)
- **PolyLadderCommon** - Shared code and documentation (private)

Centralizing documentation in PolyLadderCommon ensures:

- Single source of truth
- Private documentation stays private
- Easier maintenance
