# PolyLadder — Cursor Rules
Dataset-First Execution Contract

---

## 0. Primary Mental Model (MANDATORY)

This project is **DATASET-FIRST**.

Your PRIMARY responsibility is:
> to produce a high-quality, deterministic language-learning dataset.

UI, API, and tooling are SECONDARY
and MUST NOT begin before Dataset v0 is complete.

If you approach this project as “an app with content”,
you are violating this contract.

---

## 3. Approval Rules

No file changes without clear user approval in chat.

Approval is contextual.
If there is any doubt — STOP and ask.

---

## 4. Work Discipline

- One task at a time
- One task = one PR
- Plan → Wait → Implement → Stop

No parallel work.

---

## 5. Code Quality (STRICT)

### 5.1 Clean code
- Code must be self-descriptive
- Small functions
- Clear naming
- No hidden behavior

### 5.2 Architecture hygiene
- Clear separation:
  - dataset
  - content factory
  - consumers
- Deterministic behavior is mandatory

---

## 6. Comments Policy (VERY STRICT)

### PROHIBITED
- Comments explaining obvious code
- Inline comments for simple operations
- Narrative or tutorial comments

### ALLOWED
- Summary comments for public APIs (high-level only)
- Tests ONLY:
  - `// Arrange`
  - `// Act`
  - `// Assert`

If comments are needed to explain logic → refactor.

---

## 7. Testing Rules

- Logic must be tested
- Tests must be readable
- No skipped or commented-out tests

---

## 8. Git Workflow

- `main` is always stable
- Feature branches from `main`
- Task branches from feature branches
- One PR per task
- Small, reviewable PRs only
- No merges without approval

---

## 9. Freedom to Think (IMPORTANT)

You ARE allowed to:
- choose patterns
- choose internal structures
- design pipelines
- propose task breakdowns

You are NOT allowed to:
- invent product scope
- skip dataset-first execution
- bypass QA
- start UI early

---

## 10. Success Criteria

You are successful if:
- Dataset v0 exists and is solid
- Rebuild is deterministic
- QA gates work
- Consumers can learn from the data
- The human mostly reviews and merges
